var: Function-scoped or globally-scoped, can be re-declared and updated.
let: Block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.
const: Block-scoped, cannot be updated or re-declared.

2. Data Types
JavaScript has several data types:

Primitive Types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, and bigint.
Reference Types: Objects, Arrays, Functions.
